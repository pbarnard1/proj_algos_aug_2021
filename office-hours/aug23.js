String: In-Order Subsets
Create strSubsets(str). Return an array with every possible in-order character subset of str. The resultant array itself need not be in any specific order â€“ it is the subset of letters in each string that must be in the same order as they were in the original string. Given "abc", return an array that includes ["", "c", "b", "bc", "a", "ac", "ab", "abc"] (in any order).
["","a","b","c","ab","ac","bc","abc"]
